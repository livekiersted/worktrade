##### Let’s Trade: A Different Way to Get What We Need

I’ve always loved how generosity unlocks things that money can’t. Years ago, I realized I could get way nicer things from Craigslist Free Stuff than I could ever afford to buy. Not because people were getting rid of junk, but because when we step outside of business-as-usual, we tap into something deeper—creativity, abundance, and a way of taking care of each other that just feels better.

This list is my way of making that easy: everything I can offer, everything I need. Some things we can trade. Some things we can gift. Some things we can pay for. The point is, we get to decide together what makes the most sense.

##### Why?

- **More access, more possibility** – Make your amazing work accessible to more people. Make more people's amazing work accessible to you.
- **Giving and receiving feels amazing** – Knowing your skills made someone’s life better is priceless.
- **Not everything has to be a business** – Get something you can't buy by giving something you can't sell.
- **Trust, connection, community** – The best exchanges aren’t transactions. They’re relationships.
- **Creative abundance** – There’s so much value in the world when we stop putting limits on how we exchange.

So here’s my list. If something sparks an idea, let’s talk. Because the world we want isn’t going to build itself.
