What can you do for me?
<br>

##### Yard & Outdoor Planning 
I have an amazing yard that needs some help. I could use a space planner to help me make decisions on layout and design, skillful pruning to help my trees thrive, and gardening and landscaping to make it gorgeous (plant dahlias everywhere!)

##### Clothes Makeover
I am deeply committed to an all-pajamas-all-the-time level of comfort, but I don't want to look like a schlub. Are you a queer fashionista eager to have your way with me and my closet so that I can effortlessly be comfortable, elegant, and fabulous on the daily?

##### Hair Help
Are you a queer hairstylist ready to help me fully inhabit my forties with joy? I need a new hair situation.

##### Kitchen Projects
I hate the color of my granite countertop. I hear one can paint them, but also that it's hard to do well (and smelly.) Is this a skill you have?

My partner runs a popup Bull+Dagger BBQ out of our house. We need to upgrade the outdoor kitchen and make the laundry room shed kitchenier. Can you help with that?

##### Voice Lessons
I had sinus surgery recently and my voice works differently than it used to. I'd love a vocal coach to help me build my singing skills while using that process to move me toward self-actualization.

##### Meal Planning
The bane of my existence. I need a way to eat nutritiously while spending minimal spoons on the process of making that happen. Meals, strategies, or systems would all be helpful.

##### Massage & Bodywork
I live with pain I can't avoid. Massage helps me avoid the pain I can.

##### Retreat Space
Do you have a place within driving distance of Oakland where me and my sweetie could go spend some quality time with each other? (Must be catless, she's allergic.)

##### Flemish Coaching
Ik wil Nederlands spreken!

##### Connecting & Marketing
Bring me clients!

##### Woo
Are you one of those people who guides journeys? Receives clear downloads about other people's spiritual needs? Can tell me what my ancestors or the plants I steward are trying to say to me? But also you're super grounded and deeply practical and energetically more like a literal mountain than like an airy Californian? If so, I have growing to do in directions you might be able to help me with.

##### Handyperson Stuff
I'm pretty handy but there's always more to do than I have spoons for. Do you know how to replace rotting shingles? Plaster a room with natural clay? Build basic cabinetry? Put in a door?

##### Cash
Capitalism is a massively destructive collective delusion, but bills are real.

##### Other
Feel free to suggest something entirely else!
