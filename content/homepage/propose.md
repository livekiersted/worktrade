To propose a work trade, email live.kiersted@gmail.com and/or schedule a call below to discuss. I’m looking to build connections where both of us feel like we’re getting more than we’re giving—where our exchange nurtures us both. I believe in mutual care, equitability, and community thriving, so let’s find a way to collaborate that lifts us up together. Specificity and flexibility are both helpful, as is a clear sense of the skills and experience you’re bringing to the table. Let's make this something that benefits us both!
